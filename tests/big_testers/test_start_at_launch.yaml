# test_start_at_launch.yaml — Control whether tasks auto-start
# EXPECTED:
#   - "auto-start" starts immediately → should be "running"
#   - "manual-start" does NOT start → should stay "pending" until you `start` it
# VERIFY: `ls` → auto-start is running, manual-start is pending
#         Then `start <manual-task-id>` → manual-start should start running
